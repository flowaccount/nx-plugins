 * This class is used to create an ECS cluster stack by specifying the VPC and Subnets
 * In this class it creates the Roles and policy provided in the configurations.
 * The configuration must be provided in the registry of the interface IECSStackEnvironmentConfig
 * Please register it like this
 * import { AwsECSCluster } from '@flowaccount/aws-cdk-stack'
 * import { environment } from './environments/environment'
 * import { App } from 'aws-cdk-lib/core'
 * const app = new App()
 * const awsEcsCluster = new AwsECSCluster(app, `${environment.app}-ecs-cluster`, { ...environment, env: environment.awsCredentials } )
 *
 * P.S. please mind that within the stacks, `env: configuration.awsCredentials` has to be passed into the sub-stacks properties
 * this is to make sure they can use each other and also not fail.
